## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/) - Font Editor

### What I learned

I continued to learn more about fonts and was able to reduce the file sizes of the fonts used to 6 KB and 10 KB using FontForge. For now, I have given up on using variable fonts, as it's too much hassle for little benefit.

### Continued development

I want to deepen my understanding of accessibility and plan to do so soon. Therefore, I may revisit this project in the future to make further improvements.
